Work I produced related to reports, involving OLAP tools, such as: Power BI, SAP Dashboards, Tableau, etc.

In the 3rd image, you can see the dashboard as I started. I used Power BI Desktop for developing the dashboard, gathering information with the manager and client, as it was a partnership to track the services offered to the client, who was interested in seeing the results of the work delivered under the Central IT contract.

In the 2nd image, we already had something more refined, with a friendlier design and more rules in place. However, it was still far from the visual, filters, segments, redirection links, etc., that we needed to create a product better suited to the requirements.

In the 1st image, you can already see that the dashboard has gained a completely new look. All the necessary rules, filters, and segments were applied, in addition to enhancing the analytical details in the charts requested by the client, with the goal of evaluating the performance and results of the contract service delivery.
